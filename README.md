:tada: This a Simple ficticious online phone store made with React.

I'm currently working on a second branch, implementing react redux and react hooks it's a work in progress.

You can visit the live version of the site by clicking on this link: <a href="https://phonester.netlify.com" target="_blank">Phonester</a>.

:smiley: Or you can clone it to your own computer and hack and slash through it!

### using this command:

`git clone https://github.com/mouradaouinat/phonester.git`

:thumbsup: After that you'll need to install the developement dependencies using this command:

`npm install` OR `npm i` for short

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
